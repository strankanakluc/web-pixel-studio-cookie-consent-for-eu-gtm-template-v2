## Description

Cookie Consent by Web Pixel Studio gives you a modern, customizable, GDPR-ready cookie banner for WordPress without unnecessary complexity.

It combines a polished frontend experience with practical compliance tools: Google Consent Mode v2 and v3 support, script blocking, cookie declarations, consent logging, multilingual presets, and an admin panel built for real websites.

If you want a consent plugin that looks professional, gives visitors clear choices, and keeps you in control of cookies and third-party scripts, this plugin is built for that.

## Why This Plugin

- Modern cookie banner with box, bar, and cloud layouts
- Detailed preferences modal with category-level consent
- Google Consent Mode v2 and v3 integration ready for GA4 and Google Ads
- Script blocking before consent with simple rules or regex
- Prebuilt cookie and script presets for Google Analytics, Google Ads, Facebook Pixel, and Matomo (Analytics + Tag Manager)
- Optional Matomo mode for anonymous cookieless measurement after reject, with full tracking activated on later consent
- Built-in consent log with exportable records
- Floating consent icon so visitors can reopen settings anytime
- Multilingual presets with editable frontend texts
- Full visual control over colors, buttons, fonts, layout, and icon style

## Compliance-Friendly Workflow

The plugin helps you build a cleaner compliance workflow directly inside WordPress:

- show a clear banner before non-essential consent is granted
- let visitors accept all, reject all, or manage preferences
- block selected third-party scripts until consent exists
- keep a record of consent actions with ID and timestamp
- show declared cookies inside the preferences modal or on a policy page

This plugin is built to support GDPR and ePrivacy requirements, but legal compliance always depends on your actual implementation and jurisdiction.
